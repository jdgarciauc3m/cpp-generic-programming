\chapter*{Foreword}

Welcome!

Generic programming has become one of the cornerstones of C++ over the years.

This is not a book. It is just the support material for a course on how you can
make use of generic programming in modern C++. 
Note that this course assumes that you
already have enough background on C++.

I hope you find this course useful to improve your skills as a software
engineer allowing you to write better software.
